Difference between Plan-driven and Agile methods
-> Agile is more lean to change (flexible requirements)
-> People-driven
-> Plan driven = hard requirements, flexible time
-> Agile = lean requirements, non-flexible time

Software process models - waterfall, incremental, prototyping, and spiral
-> Unique about process model: risk management
