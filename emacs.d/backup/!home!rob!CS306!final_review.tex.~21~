\section{Exam Questions}
\label{sec:orgb3cdf32}
\subsection{Intellectual Property -- Specific factual IP Questions}
\label{sec:orgfc25ad8}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is intellectual property, and why do we protect it? What does society gain from intellectual property laws’ existence?  What trade-offs are made by the inventors/creators to obtain protection?

\begin{itemize}
\item Intellectual property is intangible form of property that is protected. Life time + 75 years.

\item It promotes innovation because more ideas are spread and at the same time protected, which promotes collection of ideas.

\item A trade off is that the creator by having his idea/work registered to copyright/trademark/patent/trade secret/etc has to allow others to use his ideas under fair use. However, they get to have their rights preserved.
\end{itemize}

\item Understand the four types of intellectual property protection, including (a) how they are obtained; (b) what requirements are necessary; (c) how they are "infringed;" (d) how long they last; and (e) how they may end or be lost:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
Type & Duration & Renew & Granted by\\
\hline
Patent & 20 years & No & USPTO\\
\hline
Trademark & 10 years & Yes & USPTO\\
\hline
Trade Secret & None & N/A & None\\
\hline
Copyright & Life + 70 years & No & US Copyright Office\\
 & 90 yeares for company &  & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}
\item How does each form of IP serve to protect intellectual property? Why are some better than others in various situations?
\item What are the five exclusive rights enjoyed by copyright holders?
\item Why must a potential copyright infringer have been exposed to the copyrighted work to be held liable?  (And does the infringer have to remember being exposed?)
\item What is "Fair Use?" Know and understand the four factors of fair use stated in Sec. 107 of the Copyright Act, including how to use them to analyze whether a specific use should be considered "fair." What does it mean if your use is "fair?"
\item Do the "fair use" and "independent creation" defenses apply to Patent infringement cases?  (No!)
\item What is the "first sale doctrine?"  What rights does it give the legitimate owner of a copyrighted work?
\item How is trademark protection historically and substantively different than any other form of intellectual property protection. (Hint: Whom does it protect?) How are trademarks relevant to domain names and cybersquatting?
\item What is "trademark dilution?" How does it occur? Is it irreversible?
\item What does it mean if a patented invention or copyrighted work is in the "public domain?"
\item What is the significance of "patent pending" on a product or advertisement?
\item Sony v. Universal City Studios:  Understand why this is an extremely important case in copyright law.  Know what happened in this case, including the background issues, the specific legal reasoning for the final outcome, details of the testimony supporting each side, and some of the "unspoken" reasons for the court's decision.  Be prepared to discuss the specific arguments and counter-arguments offered by each side.  How did Copyright and the Fair Use Doctrine apply to the case?  What is its impact on copyrighted music/videos/software today?
\item What was the Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music case about? Explain its general facts and the ruling of the court.  What does it mean for a use to be "transformative" as opposed to "derivative?"  What role did market impact play?
\item What happened in the A. \& M. Records v. Napster case? How did this ruling impact the legality of uploading/downloading copyright-protected music and videos?
\item What happened in the MGM v. Grokster case? In what way did it soften the impact of Napster? In what way did it make that impact more pronounced?
\item What is "time shifting?" What is "space shifting?" What is "vicarious liability?" What is "contributory infringement?" How are these terms significant to Sony, Napster and Grokster?
\item How do the above four cases (Sony, Campbell, Napster and Grokster) help define the meaning of "Fair Use?"
\item Be able to apply the four-part test of "Fair Use" in light of the above cases clarifying it. Understand the "totality of the circumstances" test (a/k/a the "cake test") in applying the fair use factors.
\item For each of the above cases, be prepared to discuss the basic facts, the court's ruling, and the major issues in the case.
\end{enumerate}

I-B. Int. Prop. -- Hypothetical / Essay Questions <These are meant to provide you examples of potential final exam essay questions>

Mark has drawn a picture of Pam. What three elements must his drawing satisfy for Mark to have copyright protection for his drawing? Assuming his drawing meets the requirements, when does the copyright protection begin? When does it end? What if Pam’s company hired Mark to make the drawing – who holds the copyright, and how long does it last?
Assuming that Mark is the copyright holder with respect to his drawing of Pam, what specific rights does he have?
If Mark gives the drawing to Pam, what rights does she have? Who can make copies?
How can Pam make copies of the drawing, if Mark does not give her permission? What situations would allow her to do so? Give an example, and explain how that example meets the requirements of the statute.
Assume that Mark writes a new software program that works in a brand-new, even revolutionary, way. He tells you "I want to copyright this program." What do you tell him? Can he? Why or why not?
Pam has invented a cold-fusion machine. It’s about the size of a stand-alone photocopier. When you pour in three gallons of plain tap water, the machine produces (at zero cost) 5,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. Which form of intellectual property should Pam use to protect her invention? What are the requirements of that type of protection? Does her machine qualify? How long will that protection last, and when does it begin? What about the algorithm she wrote to control the machine; is the algorithm protectable? Why or why not?
Pam calls her machine the "Fusotron" power generator. She doesn’t want anyone else to be able to use that name. What type of intellectual property protection would help her out? What does she need to do to get that protection? How long will it last?
Suppose Pam decides not to share her machine with the rest of the world. Instead, she intends to keep the machine for herself and only sell the electricity. But she wants to keep her employees from sharing the secrets of her machines with anyone else. Is there a form of intellectual property protection that she can use to do so? What are the requirements for maintaining that type of protection? How long does it last?


II. Free Speech:  \{This includes both textbook material (esp. Ch. 9) and Redbook case material.  You may also want to review my summary slide on Blackboard.\}

What is free speech? What is its opposite? (Censorship) Do we have a right to free speech in America? Says who (or what)? What does it mean? What effects has it had on society?
Why did the framers of the Constitution believe that free speech was so important?
Whom does the First Amendment govern? (The government!) Is there anyone who can censor? Who?
What does the First Amendment actually say?  Is this what it really means?  (This is a trick question \ldots{} it depends who you ask!  But what does the Supreme Court say?)
What are the different tiers of free speech?  To what do they refer, and how do they work?
Be aware that there are exceptions to free speech: obscenity, actual child pornography, certain criminal conduct that happens to have a speech component, defamation, speech presenting a clear and present danger of great harm, and certain national security issues (e.g., publishing the location and movement of troops in wartime).
What’s the difference between "actual child pornography," "virtual child pornography," and "youthful adult pornography"? How are they relevant to free speech? Are they treated the same way, or differently? What are their implications for the computer profession?
What special issues does cyberspace raise regarding free speech? How does cyberspace affect jurisdiction and community standards?
What happened with the Communications Decency Act (CDA), the Child On-Line Pornography Act (COPA), the Child Pornography Protection Act (CPPA) and the Child Internet Protection Act (CIPA)? What were they supposed to do? Did they succeed? Why or why not?  How is the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) different?  What is it designed to do?
Why do objectors to filtering software claim that it is both overbroad and underinclusive? How did this issue impact the CIPA?
What is prior restraint? What type of standard must be satisfied to impose it?  (Hint: it's even harder than the criminal standard "beyond a reasonable doubt.")  What are its constitutional implications? Give an example of how prior restraint of a website would work, and what legally is supposed to happen instead.
Describe what Brandenburg v. Ohio was about. Who was involved and what happened?  How did the court rule? What important statement does this make to us about free speech? (Hint: what is the "clear and present danger" standard?)
Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition:  What was this case about?   What distinctions does the court make about forms of protected speech? How did the court rule and what implications does this ruling have today?  How does this case represent a substantial shift in the way child pornography is now viewed by the courts?
U.S. v. Williams: Who brought this case, and why?  What were the primary issues and arguments in the case?  How did the court "thread the needle" between the issues of free speech and protecting children?  Do you agree with the ruling?  Do the specific circumstances of the case have anything to do with how the court interpreted the law?  (Hint: what is the primary purpose of the PROTECT Act?)  What is the PROTECT Act and how does it differ from the CDA and the CPPA? What difference did this make in the results of the case?)  How did this case serve to expand, limit, or clarify the ruling of Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition?  Explain whether you think the decision in Williams is consistent with that of Ashcroft?  What implications does these rulings have today?
Pentagon Papers case:  You should have a thorough understanding of the background and context of this case, as well as an understanding of the primary issues and arguments. What was this case about?  Why is this case unusual? What is the difference between a plurality and a majority?  How did the various justices view the issues, and how did their views of separation of powers affect their opinions?  (You should have at least a modest grasp of each justice's opinion, and a more in-depth comprehension of at least three or four of the justices' outlooks.) What important concern about reading cases in general was exemplified by the case? (Hint: Is the majority view the only one that is significant?  What significance does each opinion have?)  What conclusions can we draw from this case about our constitutional right to free speech?  What does the case tell you about prior restraint?
Why is it important to read the dissenting views in a case? How is the Pentagon Papers a particularly good example of this?  (Hint: what information is provided in the dissent that is not included in the majority opinion?) 
Commonwealth v. Jeremy Jaynes:  What did Jeremy Jaynes do, and what happened to him in the lower court?  On what grounds did he appeal, and how did the court respond?   You will be expected to know the various issues from Jeremy Jaynes, esp. those relating directly to the court’s analysis of free speech, including how the court ruled on each of the five issues.  Be sure you also understand how anonymity was significant, why jurisdiction was an issue, why the law was determined to be overbroad, whether Jaynes’ actions were also viewed as trespass, and why the court refused to allow a narrowing construction to save the statute.

III. Basic Law and Ethics:

Understand how law and ethics interrelate. How do they differ? (Does law come from ethics? Do ethics come from law? Think about whether either or both of these make sense.)
What is the difference between statutory law and case law? Where does each come from? 
What is "precedent" in connection with law? When must a judge follow "precedent?" What will happen if s/he does not?
Understand the various court systems we have discussed, and which precedent will be considered binding on a Virginia court.
Understand the various parts of a legal case (facts, opinion, ruling) and the case terminology discussed in class (affirm, reverse, remand, concur, uphold, dissent, majority, plurality, etc.)
What is a "preliminary injunction" and a "permanent injunction"? 
What is the difference between civil and criminal law?  Can a cause of action be both?  (Yes!  For example, "assault and battery.")  Can a statute be used for both?  (Yes!  For example, the CFAA!)
What information is important to include in a case legal citation? (Parties in the case, name of court, year case was decided, and preferably reporter name, volume \# and page \#)
What is shepardization? Why is it important?  How is it useful?  What problems might be caused by failing to do it?
Why is the Constitution considered the "Supreme law of the land?" How does this work in actual cases?
What if the U.S. Supreme Court thinks a proposed law will be unconstitutional? Can they just tell Congress not to pass it? Why or why not?
How does the concept of "separation of powers" play out in creating, enforcing and interpreting law?  What does the case "Washington v. Trump" tell us about this?
What is the difference between federal law and state law? How does each relate to the other? Can you appeal from state court to federal court? (Not usually!)
What is a "discussion stopper," and how does it interfere with a debate about whether something is ethical or not? Understand and be prepared to name and discuss the four "discussion stoppers" discussed in class and on Pg. 51 (or thereabouts, depending on the edition) of your textbook.
What is the Golden Rule?  Is it usable?  Why or why not?  Does it make a difference as to who is involved?
How is a judge's opinion different from that of an average person's? (A judicial opinion is LAW! )

IV. Philosophical Ethics:  \{Review summary on Blackboard slide\}

What is Relativistic ethics? Be prepared to explain subjective relativism and cultural relativism, and their major flaws as ethical theories.
What is the Divine Command Theory? Is it usable? Does it make a difference as to what setting you are in?
Explain the principles of (Rule) Deontology. Remember what it is based on (duty) and how intent and actions are important, while consequences are not.
Be prepared to explain and apply the two parts of Kant's Categorical Imperative to determine an appropriate deontological response to a specific situation.
Explain the principles of Utilitarianism. (All consequences, all the time! But is this the same as saying "the majority rules" ?? No!)
How does Act Utilitarianism differ from Rule Utilitarianism? You should be able to clearly explain the distinctions, as well as the pros and cons of each variety.
Be able to use either Act Utilitarianism or Rule Utilitarianism to analyze a specific situation. (Remember that all parties should be considered, benefits and detriments examined and weighed.)
What is Social Contract Theory? Why is it the closest theory to suggesting that simply "following the law" is what is ethical? Why is this simplistic suggestion not fully explanatory of the theory? (Hint: under what circumstances might a social contract theorist \textbf{not} follow the law, yet stay consistent with this theory?)
Be able to use Social Contract Theory to analyze a specific situation.
What is Virtue Ethics? How is Virtue Ethics fundamentally different in its approach from all other theories we have discussed?
Be prepared to analyze a situation using Virtue Ethics. (Remember that the analysis is about what action(s) would serve to improve your virtuous character, NOT trying to determine what actions a virtuous person would take.)
Consider the strengths and weaknesses of each philosophical approach in Q. 1 - 11. Be prepared to discuss the various facets of each theory, including their ease of use, likelihood of reaching an appropriate conclusion, cost, and whether following them might result in "unjust" or "unethical" results in certain circumstances.
State an ethics dilemma, and explain how an ethicist of each type would resolve the dilemma. What result(s) would they achieve? Would they all arrive at the same result? Why or why not?
Based on current self-reflection, which theory comes closest to your own approach to ethical decision-making? Why?


V. Logic

What is a logical argument (as used in this class)? What form must it take?  (Use our in-class "three statement" definition, please.)
Why is it useful to phrase things using logical reasoning? What advantage(s) does separating validity and soundness provide?
Define a valid argument, a sound argument, an inductive argument, and a fallacious argument. Give an example of each.
Be able to determine whether an argument is valid, invalid, sound and unsound.  Be prepared to explain why an argument is or is not valid/sound.
What is a fallacy? Why don’t we like using them?
Be able to define, recognize, name, and explain the problems and/or provide an example of an argument demonstrating the following subset of the fallacies presented in your textbook:

ad hominem (attacking the person rather than the substance of the argument)
appeal to authority (inverse of ad hominem)
slippery slope (incremental assumptions)
"false cause" (post hoc, ergo propter hoc)
begging the question (circular reasoning)
fallacies of composition/division  (characteristics of a whole = characteristics of each part)
fallacy of common characteristics (Prof. Maddox's name for the odd textbook example for the fallacy of ambiguity: "If two things share a characteristic, they must be the same")
fallacy of ambiguity (different meanings for same term)
appeal to the people (argumentum ad populum).
"many/any" fallacy (a characteristic common to many = common to any particular one)
virtuality fallacy (matters pertaining to the "virtual" world aren't significant) 

VI.  Software Liability/Reliability/Accountability <from Chapter 4 of your Textbook>:

What is a "safety critical" system?  Why is it significant?  How does this impact appropriate level of safeguards for software developers?
What is the Therac-25?  What was it for?  What went wrong with it?  (Be aware of the many tangential problems in addition to the specific technical ones.)
What happened to the Space Shuttle Challenger? Could it have been avoided? How?  (Hint: this was a \textbf{failure} to whistle-blow!)
What was the Denver Airport baggage handling fiasco?
What happened with the Ford Pinto?  Could it have been avoided?  How?  Was Ford's decision unethical, or simply good business?


VII. In-Class Mock Trials and Creative Project Presentations: Be generally familiar with each of the mock trials/creative projects in your class and the legal/ethical issues they raised.  I do not expect an in-depth knowledge of the law or facts of any trial/project (except your own ;).  However, each of you either sat through a trial or lengthy presentation for each of these, so I do expect a very basic comprehension of the what each trial/project was about and its primary legal issues.  

VIII.  Court Terminology and Rules of Evidence.  Finally, be prepared to discuss case terminology and matters pertaining to court cases generally, as learned throughout the mock trial assignment process.  Specifically, you should know the GMU rules of evidence and be able to identify or provide examples of the following evidentiary objections:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Relevance
\item Calls for a Conclusion
\item Calls for Speculation
\item Assumes facts not in evidence
\item Hearsay
\item Leading the Witness
\item Asked and Answered
\item Counsel is Testifying
\end{enumerate}
