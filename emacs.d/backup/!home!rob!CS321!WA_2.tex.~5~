\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
\item Contributions
\end{enumerate}
-> There have been multiple phases for the CS321 project. The first phase started out to
collect ideas from the team members and choose an interesting project that may motivate the
majority of the team. Different members of the team had different ideas on what to make for
this project. However, some of the ideas were too broad, and some were way out of our
league to even finish developing in the course of the semester. In this process of confusion
and clashing of ideas, I somewhat helped the team by sort of drifting them into focusing on
one big subject instead of having multiple directions for the project. In our case the big subject
was an alarm clock, with some features or multitudes of features that some users may want to
see in a single app. Although a bit broad, that was our initial project idea if I am not suffering
from a potential memory loss.
The second phase of the project, which we did horribly on, was about requirement
engineering. Prior to this, we had already set up a slack server to talk about the project and
the required documents to submit. So the goal was to write a 'technical paper' with list of use
cases and requirements for the specific application we were building. Lacking any
knkowledge on how a technical paper should look like, we somehow managed to make a
serious mistake of making a technical paper wordy. But not only that, making it wordy
destructs the goal of making a clear suggestions and statements to its readers and especially
us developers. Even now, I can assure the readers that they won't be able to connect every
pieces of information together by just reading it once. In terms of my contribution, I worked on
parts of everything except the traceability part, but I think I worked mostly on requirements
and use cases. We also had fact-to-fact meetings at this point to work on P1.
I think P2 is when our ideas because visualized. Before that, we had vague understanding
of how the app should function or even look like. Because we were not so sure whether or not
we had same vision in our heads for this project, all four of us met in person to make sure that
everything is clarified for everyone. I sketched how the app should sort of look like, and other
agreed on it, and we all started off from there. Because we visualized that time, everyone
knew clearly on how everything should work in hand to hand. There were some other
decisions that we did not stress well enough, but those were only minor issues in my
understanding. We also went to the TA to discuss further about the document. We cut down
significant bits of gibberish from our P2 document.
For P3, my major contribution to the team was to draw class diagrams. Other than that, I
also did some contributions in regards to technology. We set up our Git repo during this phase
to make sure how everyone should handle. And for some of the mebers who weren't really
sure about how branching works in git, I explained with some drawings how one should use
git without trouble.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What did you learn about working on a team project?
\end{enumerate}
-> I have done some prior project which were team-based. The main problem that, because
we are still students and we lack work experiences, and have some misunderstanding on how
the project should be handled. For this particular project, we had some disagreements in the
beginning, but I think that was due to everyone not exaclty thinking the same thing. My idea
for the project development (or process) was that we initially agree on an app to build. And
features or requirements to the app are made during discussions in group meetings. The
same happened for most of our group meetings, but first one or two meetings did not go as
planned in my opinion.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What did you learn about project leadership in a team project?
\end{enumerate}
-> I think leadership takes skill. A leader needs to have knowledge on all the technical skills
the project is requiring. Not only that, the leader needs to be aware of what is going on with
different team members. Leader must also be able to hear out for different opinions, and know
which opinions to take and which opinions to scrap.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How frequently did your team meet face-to-face? Were there any issues with meeting in-
\end{enumerate}
person? How productive were the meetings?
-> We met at least once a week, if not twice a week. But it was hard to cope with the
meetings for four different people. Some meetings in the beginning of the semester were not
as productive due to not having a focused vision for the project. We had some meetings to go
over development environment setup, and git. I think those were semi-productive. It should
benefit all the members to be on the same boat when using those technologies. But aside
from in-person meetings, we also utilize a slack server that deals with all the
information/documentation sharing.
\begin{enumerate}
\item From your perspective, what went well on the project?
\end{enumerate}
→ I can’t really conclude on what went well on the project since we haven’t delivered our final
product yet. But one thing that went well all around is that everyone have been good at
meeting in person. There were some times when we had some scheduling difficulties but we
managed to find a time when everyone was free and people all showed up to those sessions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item From your perspective, what did not go well on the project?
\end{enumerate}
→ I think what did not go well about the project is that we had some hard time coming up with
a good idea. But also, we weren’t really sure about how the end-product should look like for
the project. Also we had some communication problems, which resulted in people
misunderstanding. And we still can’t get a glimpse of what we were trying to do based on the
earlier project deliverables.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on your experiences this semester, what would you do differently next time on a
\end{enumerate}
software development project?
→ I think I will be more technical and precise, make sure nobody tries to overly describe
something. I think all technical conversations should be on point, especially if you don’t know
others’ backgrounds.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on your experience, what would you advise a project team starting CS/SWE 321?
\end{enumerate}
→ Make sure that everyone on the team are on the same page. We had hard time coping
with that, mainly due to people talking similar things but not similar picture in their head. Early
sketches of the overall project definitely helps in envisioning it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Was this a good project to work on or would you have preferred a different one? Why/why
\end{enumerate}
not?
→ I sort of feel like we should have done a web app. It would’ve been much easier to set
everything up since almost everything web is cross-platform. We are doing android, and we
wasted some hours trying to get the dev environment set up, especially on multiple operating
systems, OS X, Windows, and Linux.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on your assessment of how they performed, assign a grade (0 – 100) to each
\end{enumerate}
member of your team. You can also include N (for no comment). Write a few sentences
