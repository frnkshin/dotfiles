\maketitle
In \emph{Moon Microsystems v. Zucchini}, the plaintiff claimed that defendant used domain names similar to the \emph{Mocha Programming Language}, which was developed by the plaintiff, in bad faith to gain financial benefits. The decision of the jury was found in favor of the defendant due to the plaintiff's failure in identifying defendant's deliberate use of the domain names for their commercial gain.

Evidences found in the court in relation to the plaintiff's claims are as follows: Zucchini's coffee shop saw an increase in customers after the launch of \emph{Mixing Moonlight and Mocha}; Zucchini registered multiple domain names containing \emph{moon} and \emph{mocha}; Zucchini's blog did not contain any information pertaining to the \emph{Mocha Programming Language}. During the cross-examination of Mr. Zucchini by the plaintiff counsel, it was revealed that Zucchini's coffee shop gained increase in customers and sales. The plaintiff counsel failed to reveal any other testimonies from the cross-examination that may have helped in establishing usage of \emph{mocha} and \emph{moon} brand names to the sole factor in financial gains of Zucchini's coffee shop, however. Secondly, Zucchini also testified that he had multiple domain names registered using \emph{moon} and \emph{mocha} brand names. Although Zucchini retained ownership of multiple domains related to Moon Microsystems' franchise, the plaintiff counsel was not able to make Zucchini testify that he held the ownership to either sell the domains to make profit or diverge the website traffic to Moon Microsystems with similar domain names. Lastly, the defendant did not have any prior experience with the \emph{Mocha Programming Language}, which revealed to the members of the jury that the defendant's choice of his domain name was purely based on luck.

With the evidence presented to the court by both parties and the witnesses, my impression was that the defendant will win the case. Broadly, the plaintiff's claim was that the defendant deliberately registered the domain names to gain financial benefits. However, the evidence did not show enough support for the plaintiff. The evidences merely showed that the defendant unknowingly used the names \emph{mocha} and \emph{moon} due to his love for coffee and late night.

After the trial was over, both the plaintiff's and the defendant's secrets were revealed. The plaintiff's secret was that the Wu Zheng-Shi, the plaintiff friendly witness, took the name \emph{Mocha} from the defendant's coffee shop back in 1999. In contrary, the defendant's secret was that Lisa Barista, the defendant friendly witness, knew about the \emph{Mocha Programming Language} while she was publishing blog posts on the web site. If both of the secrets were revealed during the cross-examinations, I would have sided with the plaintiff, because the goal of the case was to prove that the defendant knowingly used the terms \emph{mocha} and \emph{moon} in his domain; and the fact that Wu Zheng-Shi took the name of \emph{Mocha Programming Language} from Zucchini's coffee shop is not the subject of the court for this trial.

Aside from the case however, I was biased toward the plaintiff. The main reason is that the Moon Microsystems resembled Oracle a lot. On a side note, Oracle is a software corporation that has sued numerous open source projects including Android Operating System for using their programming language, Java. Oracle owns the right to the \emph{Java Programming Language} after its purchase of Sun Microsystems. Oracle also took numerous open source projects that were being sponsored by Sun Microsystems prior to its purchase by Oracle. Oracle attempted to manage these open sources projects tailored to its taste with even less support than what Sun Microsystems previously provided. One famous outcome of this is that Open Office project became discontinued after its developers left the project due to Oracle 'bossing' them around.

The jury deliberation went accordingly. Most of the people in the jury group decided that the plaintiff failed to prove his claims, and sided with the defendant. The jury voted in favor of the defendant in both of the legal question and the ethical question. Even though the jury deliberation was almost as close to being unanimous, inspecting the jury form gave me room to think more about the case. In my opinion, the legal questions presented to the jury were a bit favored toward the defendant. I think if the legal questions were a bit more geared toward the trademark conflict, I would have voted in favor of the plaintiff in the legal questions. Although it was not revealed that there were any financial damages to the plaintiff, trademark conflict would indeed make the defendant to give up his domain names referenced in Moon Microsystems v. Zucchini.
