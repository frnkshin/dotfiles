\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:orgbe17a38}

There were multiple phases for the team project. The first phase started by collecting ideas from individual team members, and then choosing an interesting project to give a motivation boost to  the majority of the team. Different members of the team had different ideas on what to build. However, some of the ideas were too broad, and some were deemed too complex to finish developing in the course of the semester. There were lots of confusion and clashing of ideas during this phase. Somebody had to take a step and come up with a project from the ideas generated by the team. Technically, I wasn't the decision maker, but I took the individual ideas from everyone in the team, and came up with our final idea of building a smart alarm app for Android.

With the beginning of the second phase of the project, I created a Slack server and a Github repository for our project. We used Slack as the major mode for communicating outside of the classroom. I pitched in ideas for the second phase of the project. It was primarily focused on coming up with functional requirements and use-cases of the app we were building. If my memory serves me correctly, I think I contributed most of the functional and non-functional requirements that are listed on the assignment. Also, I frequently tried to make our responses into shorter format to offer better readability for the readers.

For the third phase, architectural design, I took out buzzwords that were causing a meaningless conversation between the members of the team. Previously, our technical paper was too wordy and contained words that required non-wordy, precise definitions for the readers to understand. This caused the team members to not be on exactly the same page when talking about one thing. In order to overcome such problem, I drew the whole sketch of the program and noted on what each UI component's action will be. This definitely put everyone on the same page by scraping buzzwords.

For the fourth assignment, which was about software design, I laid out what tools to use for the project. We came up with a team decision to use React-Native, which was not necessarily a wise decision. Not everyone was familiar with Javascript, and using React-Native was to complex. For instance, in order to use React-Native in a Java environment, you have to edit the Java code to use React-Native modules, and there were other life cyles of the React-Native objects that we had to handle.

\section{Lessons}
\label{sec:org33a390d}

I have done some prior project which were team-based. The main problem that, because we are still students and we lack work experiences, and have some misunderstanding on how the project should be handled. For this particular project, we had some disagreements in the beginning, but I think that was due to everyone not exaclty thinking the same thing. My idea for the project development (or process) was that we initially agree on an app to build. And features or requirements to the app are made during discussions in group meetings. The same happened for most of our group meetings, but first one or two meetings did not go as planned in my opinion.

\section{Leadership}
\label{sec:org2aea610}

One thing I learned about leadership after working on this project was that, leadership takes skill and experienc. A leader needs to have knowledge on all the technical skills the project is requiring. Not only that, the leader needs to be aware of what is going on with different team members. Leader must also be able to hear out for different opinions, and know which opinions to take and which opinions to scrap.

\section{Meetings}
\label{sec:org4fbb0e7}

We met at least once a week, if not twice a week. But it was hard to cope with the meetings for four different people. Some meetings in the beginning of the semester were not as productive due to not having a focused vision for the project. We had some meetings to go over development environment setup, and git. I think those were semi-productive. It should benefit all the members to be on the same boat when using those technologies. But aside from in-person meetings, we also utilize a slack server that deals with all the information/documentation sharing.

\section{Well-done Things}
\label{sec:org481092a}

One thing that went well all around is that everyone have been good at meeting in person. There were some times when we had some scheduling difficulties but we managed to find a time when everyone was free and people all showed up to those sessions.

\section{Not-so-well-done Things}
\label{sec:org20b7a97}

I think what did not go well about the project is that we had some hard time coming up with a good idea. But also, we weren’t really sure about how the end-product should look like for the project. Also we had some communication problems, which resulted in people misunderstanding. I think we wasted some time working collaboratively. For instance, to learn new technology you need to spend some lone time to read over the manuals and follow tutorials. However we didn't have those sessions, and it definitely hurt some people in terms of their contributions.

\section{Differnet Approaches for Future}
\label{sec:org7d53946}

I think I will be more technical and precise, make sure nobody (including myself) tries to overly describe something. I think all technical conversations should be on point and be precise, especially if you don’t know others’ backgrounds.

\section{Advises for Future Class}
\label{sec:orgb28f433}

One advise I would like to include is that, make sure that everyone on the team are on the same page. We had hard time coping with that, mainly due to team members talking while not on same page. Early sketches of the overall project definitely helps in envisioning your project. One way to cope with this issue might be to actually go for TDD.

\section{Project Topic Assessment}
\label{sec:org088c3c5}

I think this was an okay project. We should have taken more time into what each person can do, and then chosen a project based on each person's skill set. Although everyone had some experience with Java, learning Android SDK was not really easiest thing to do in the middle of semester.
